1/ cnn6.py was used to build a test convolutional neural net with transpose convolution.
2/ cnn6.h5 is the neural net that was built.
3/ read_each_layer.py is then used to produce each output of cnn6.h5 and prints csv files to /layer_outputs.
4/ codejenn is then used to generate cnn6.h.
5/ test.cpp was generated along with cnn6.h and is used to perform inference for cnn6.h that is then compared to the last output layer in /layer_outputs.
